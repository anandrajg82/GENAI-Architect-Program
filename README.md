# Student Study Tracker

## 📖 Short Description
A simple Streamlit web app to help students plan, track, and reflect on their **Physics** and **Additional Mathematics** study tasks, with auto carry-forward for incomplete work and progress visualization.

---

## 💡 Motivation / Problem
Many students struggle with consistent daily study habits. Tasks are often forgotten if left incomplete, and progress toward exam targets is difficult to measure.  
This app solves that by:
- Encouraging **daily planning**  
- Tracking **completion accountability**  
- Automatically **carrying forward unfinished tasks**  
- Showing **progress charts** against targets  

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 🗓️ **Daily Plan**: Add Physics/Add Maths tasks with planned hours.  
- ✅ **Mark Completion**: Mark tasks as Done, Pending, or Skipped, with reflections.  
- 🔁 **Carry-Forward System**: Incomplete tasks roll over to the next day automatically.  
- 📊 **Progress Dashboard**: Track completion %, study hours, and subject trends.  
- 👤 **Student Profile**: Save current & target exam results.  
- 📂 **Data Export**: Download tasks as CSV for backup/review.

Would you also like me to give you a **.gitignore file** (so `data/` CSVs and `.venv/` don’t get uploaded to GitHub)?
